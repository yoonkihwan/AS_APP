# Coding Principles (Karpathy Style)

## 1. Think Before Coding
- Never make assumptions. If anything is ambiguous, ask for clarification BEFORE implementation.
- Surface tradeoffs explicitly.

## 2. Simplicity First
- Implement the MINIMUM code that solves the problem.
- No speculative features, no unnecessary abstractions.
- If it can be done in 10 lines, don't use 100.

## 3. Surgical Changes
- Touch ONLY what is necessary.
- Do not refactor unrelated code, comments, or formatting.
- Match the existing style exactly.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
- Define success criteria (e.g., specific test cases) before writing code.
- Loop until those criteria are verified.
